I'm a freelance web developer currently based between in Spain working with mostly UK and US customers but open to customers anywhere in the World.

I consider myself a full stack developer being able to work both on the frontend and well as the backend. My currently tools of the trade are:

* Ruby and its many frameworks such as: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and Padrino
* Javascript on the frontend with the help of jQuery, Backbone and Raphael.js among others.
* Semantic correct and standard based HTML and CSS including HTML5 technologies and CSS3

Please do get in touch and we can start a conversation on what your needs are and how I can help your company.
