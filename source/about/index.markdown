My name is Filipe Moreira and I'm a freelance web and mobile developer currently focusing on Ruby on Rails and Javascript applications.

I also contribute to open source projects. Check my humble [Ruby on Rails contributions page](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/filipe-moreira/commits) and my [Github profile](https://github.com/filipeamoreira) for more details.

I consider myself a full stack developer being able to work both on the frontend and well as the backend. My currently tools of the trade are:

* Ruby and its many frameworks such as: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and Padrino
* Javascript on the frontend with the help of jQuery, Backbone and Raphael.js among others.
* Semantic correct and standard based HTML and CSS including HTML5 technologies and CSS3
